- siemreap unicode
- battambang

- khmer os content

(links and packaging instructions are in each OS guide.)

---

## keyboard suggestions

- use the official built-in Khmer keyboard when available
- try third-party keyboards when the built-in one is not convenient
- for linux, use ibus with the khmer input engine or fcitx if preferred
- for android, try popular Khmer keyboard apps listed in `guides/android.md`

---

## troubleshooting

common issues and what to check:

1. missing characters or boxes appearing
   - confirm you installed a Khmer unicode font and restarted the app or OS
   - check app-specific font settings (office apps, browsers)

2. incorrect spacing or broken rendering
   - make sure shaping support is available in the OS (modern versions of Windows, macOS, Android, and recent Linux distributions)
   - update your font to a Khmer-specific font that supports proper shaping

3. keyboard doesn't type Khmer
   - ensure input method is enabled in system settings
   - restart the device after enabling or installing input methods
